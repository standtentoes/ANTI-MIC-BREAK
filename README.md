betterdiscord plugin for discord packers, whenever your mic breaks you click the button it revives your microphone & your audio
instead of having to go all the way into your discord voice & video settings & reselecting your mic & headphones

I've been actually working on this for a while originally i tried to attatch it to audio.dg in task manager
& create something much more complex, but it works 50x better this way & is way easier
